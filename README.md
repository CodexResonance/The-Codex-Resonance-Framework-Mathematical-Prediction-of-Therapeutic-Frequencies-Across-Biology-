## 📖 Overview
This repository contains the research paper *The Codex Resonance Framework: Mathematical Prediction of Therapeutic Frequencies Across Biological Systems*.  

The framework demonstrates that biological systems achieve maximal, selective response when external driving frequencies align with their intrinsic timescales (`ρx ≈ Cx`).  
This law of selective coherence unifies frequency therapies across domains from neurology and oncology to structured water, acoustic coupling, and DNA-level dynamics.

## 🔑 Key Contributions
- **Universal Resonance Law**: `ρx = ω · τx ≈ Cx` explains why FDA-approved therapies (TTFields 200 kHz, PEMF 15 Hz, rTMS 6–40 Hz) work exactly where they do.  
- **Validation**: 100% predictive accuracy across seven established biological therapies.  
- **Predictions**: New therapeutic frequency ranges for mitochondria (1.6 kHz), protein folding (0.16 MHz), and DNA resonance (0.16 THz).  
- **Extensions**: Layered transmission (HueForge analogy), octave ladder harmonics, selective tumor vs. normal tissue response (~7× selectivity).  
- **Applications**: Structured water, glyph resonance, acoustic coupling, and personalized medicine protocols.
